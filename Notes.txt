Programming

C Programming
- General Purpose
  - could be used for any purpose
  - like embedded system
  - Desktop Application
  - Browser Extension
- Procedural Language
- Structured
- Compiled Language
==================================
Basics
Variables and Data Types
Input Output
Operators
Control Statements - If Else, Loops, Switch Case...
Functions
Array and Strings
Pointers
Storage Class
Macros
Struct, Enum, Union
Memory Management
File Handling
------------------------------------


- Print Simple Hello World
- Ways to Define main
- Tokens
  - smallest unit of C Program
Tokens are of 6 different types
- Keywords
- Operators
- Strings
- Constants
- Identifiers
- Special Characters

Keywords and Identifiers

Keywords
- reserved words used for a specific task
- you cannot use Keywords for defining variables or functions

Variable


Data Types
- type of data

Primitive
- Numeric
- Text

5 main data types
- int
- float
- char
- double
- void

Non-Primitive (Derived Data Types)
- Array
- Pointers
- functions
- strcutures
- union

User-Defined Data Types
- typedef
- enum

Implementing Data Types

int             %d
char            %c
float           %f

First Program in C to take input and show output

Command Line Arguments

HW 
- Build Calculator using CLI
  Calc.exe 10 20

- Build Marks Calculator by taking input from  user using scanf
  - take marks of 5 subjects
  - get percentage and total and average marks of student
  - assign grades to students
    - if percentage is above 90 and below 100 then A+ grade
    - if percentage is above 80 and below 90 then A grade
    - if percentage is above 70 and below 80 then B+ grade
    - if percentage is above 60 and below 70 then B+ grade
    - Otherwise C grade


Operators
1. Arithmetic Operators (+, -, /, *, %)
2. Relational Operators (==, >, <, >=, <=, !=)
3. Logical Operators    (&&, ||, !)
4. Bitwise Operators    (&, |, <<, >>, ^, ~)
5. Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, /=, *=, %=)
6. Other Operators
    - Ternary Operators (?:)
    - Unary Operators   (++, --)


Bitwise Operators
- Bitwise AND - &
- Bitwise OR - |
- Bitwise XOR - ^
- Left Shift - <<
- Right Shift -- >>
- Bitwise NOT - ~

X     Y     X & Y     X | Y     X ^ Y
0     0       0         0         0
0     1       0         1         1
1     0       0         1         1
1     1       1         1         0


Control Flow
If Else
If Else Ladder

- Max of Two
- Max of Three
- Odd Even
- Age Validator
- Leap Year

Loops

- for loop 
  - here we know how many times we have to execute a code
- while loop 
  - here we have a condition, till the condition is true loop will keep on executing
- do...while loop
  - loop executes atleast once even if condition is false

Break and Continue
Switch Case

Exercise
- Convert Days to years, weeks and days
  - i/p : 789 - number of days
  - o/p : Years = 2, Weeks = 8, Days = 3

- Check if a number is prime number
  - i/p : 17
  - o/p : yes
  - i/p : 49
  - o/p : no

1. Write a C program to find sum of all even numbers between 1 to n.
2. Write a C program to print multiplication table of any number.
  i/p : 2
  o/p : 2 x 1 = 2
3. Write a C program to find HCF (GCD) of two numbers.
4. Write a C program to find LCM of two numbers.
5. Count digits in a number
  i/p : 21313
  o/p : 5
6. Count number of zeros in a number
7. Create a pizza order system
  - show pizza menu to customer
