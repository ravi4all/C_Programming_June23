File Handling
- read and write operations in a file

2 types of files
- text
- binary - images, audio, video, .exe files

Steps to perform file Handling
- Open -> always tell mode of file (read/write/append) while opening
- Read/Write
  - if file is open in read mode than we cannot perform write operations
  - if file is open in write mode than we cannot perform read operations
- Close
  - Once file is closed none of the operations will work

How to open file : fOpen("file_name", "file_mode")

Modes
- r / rb, before opening a file make sure file already exists
- w / wb, before opening a file it will create new file if file does not exists
- a / ab
- r+ / rb+
- w+ / wb+
- a+ /ab+
